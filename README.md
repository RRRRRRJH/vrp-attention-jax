JAX + Attention Learn To Solve Routing Problems
===============================================

Reinplementation of the paper 
[Attention, Learn to Solve Routing Problems!](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08475) using
[Jax](https://github.com/google/jax) and [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax).
Fully suitable for multiple GPU and TPU execution.

Huge thanks to previous implementations in PyTorch and TensorFlow.
